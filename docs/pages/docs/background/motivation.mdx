# Philosophy

React is a great framework for many reasons, but one that draws many people in is its flexibility. React is not just limited to web development; it can also be used to build [native apps](https://reactnative.dev/) and even [command-line apps](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)!

The idea of sharing code betwen web and native is very exciting! However, if you're a web developer used to DOM elements, building apps with only `View` and `Text` components from [React Native for Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) (or `Stack` and `Text` from [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/)) may feel foreign. That's because these tools focus on sharing native conventions with the web, not the other way around.

This has been done with good reason: **React Native is not React DOM**. Let's look at a few examples:

- On the web, you can simply enable scrolling by setting `overflow: auto` via CSS. On native, you have to wrap the scrollable components with a `ScrollView`.
- On the web, linking to different pages is done with an `a` element and an `href` attribute. On native, there is no semantic difference between a link and a button â€” they're both just `Pressable`s with a different callback.
- On the web, gradients can be rendered on any element via CSS. On native, you have to use an external library like [react-native-linear-gradient](https://github.com/react-native-linear-gradient/react-native-linear-gradient) to render gradients via the `LinearGradient` component.

And so, these libraries have opted to prioritize native over web conventions. However, every decision comes at a cost and, as we see it, there is one main pillar that has been affected: accessibility.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is baked into the web. Semantic elements (like `h1`, `button`, and `header`) inform screen readers how to read the DOM and navigate a page. [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes) provide additional information to screen readers to build complex interactive components not native to the web, like modal dialogs, tabs, and context menus.

React Native, on the other hand, does not have semantic elements (beyond select components like `Text`, `TextInput`, and `Image`). Screen reader interactivity is defined via [roles and accessibility props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility), which are inspired by (but not 1:1 to) ARIA attributes.

How have other libraries tried to bridge the gap?

- React Native for Web defines accessibility information via props. The `role` prop is used to _infer_ the correct tag for each elements, while [`aria-*` props](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/accessibility/) map 1:1 to React DOM and to analagous `accessibility*` props on React Native. While this is a fine approach, inferring the tag based on role is fragile; why not just let engineers choose the tag directly?
- Tamagui does something similar, but has a more explicit approach. Every component exposes a `tag` prop that lets you define the exact semantic element to use on the web. While this solves React Native for Web's issue, it introduces a new problem: the use of a prop makes the semantic meaning of the component a _variable selection_ and not inherent to the component itself.
