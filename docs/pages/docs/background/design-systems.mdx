# Design Systems

A design system is a hierarchy of **styles**, **components**, and **patterns** that can be used by designers and engineers to build any number of applications.

**Styles** are the atoms of the design system. They describe how the system should look, feel, and (in some cases) sound. These may include:

- Color
- Shape
- Typography
- Iconography
- Motion
- Sound
- Haptics

**Components** are the molecules of the design system. They follow your style guidelines and add interactivity and functionality specific to your app. Some common components you might find include:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Inputs

Lastly, **patterns** are the organisms of the design system. They are reusable groups of components that bring new meaning. Some common patterns may be:

- Forms
- Confirmation dialogs
- Navigation bars
